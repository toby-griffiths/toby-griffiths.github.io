            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I sometimes consider myself an advertisers worst target.  Unless they catch me in just the right mood, at just the right 
time with something that I already kind of like or want, then their efforts are actually more likely to put me off 
buying their products.</p>

<p>So when I went to the dentist the other day, and I'm sat in the waiting room, surrounded by posters for this toothpaste, 
mouthwash and teeth whitening offerings, it got me thinking… I go to the dentist to make sure I have health teeth. I 
trust the knowledge and skill of my dentist to perform this 6 monthly oral MOT and keep things running as they should… 
but when it comes to the end of my appointment, I always receive a recommendation for a new toothbrush, tooth paste or 
mouthwash. Now I accept I'm not the best at cleaning my teeth, so some extra help is needed, but when they then proceed 
to produce a pre-printed pad showing all the oral toothbrush options, and another for Listerene mouthwashes, to tick and 
hand to me, it's difficult to believe that they're giving me the best advice tor me, rather than the financial benefit 
of their business.</p>

<p>I wondered whether the Colgate branded "Leading Practice award" in reception was a recognition of excellence in 
dentistry? Or, as as my thoughts questioned, for selling a load of Colgate products?</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I appreciate, as a business owner myself, that businesses have to make a profit, but it's difficult 
in a world were advertising is everywhere, who do you trust? Am I just a lone sceptic in an otherwise accepting world?</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I've finally got round to doing what I said I was going to do, and get this blog back up and running again.  I've 
never really been one for writing, but over the last few years I've come to realise that the thoughts and knowledge in 
my head might actually be of use to a few other people.  I've also started to realise that I can have a positive effect 
on the world, if I want to, by sharing my thoughts an ideas with anyone who'd like to listen.</p>

<p>I think about a lot.  I'm passionate about a lot.  I'm also very aware that, whist I love the person I am today, I know 
that I will only ever be the best me I can be (in this existence, anyway) when I run out of time to learn anything more. 
So I thought I would share my journey, my lessons, my thoughts &amp; inspirations in the hope that they have a positive 
effect on anyone who cares to read them here in my new blog.</p>

<p>I was going to add a typical 'About me' page to this blog, but as someone very close to me suggests, surely the contents 
of each post I write in this blog is a far better way of finding out about who I am, so here is me… who I was, and who I 
am, and who I hope to become.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the read.</p>
