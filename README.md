Setting Up
----------

To get up and running, see the [Sculpin Getting Started Guide](https://sculpin.io/getstarted/)



Publishing
----------

When you're ready to publish the blog, run the `./prepare.sh` script.  This will prepare the production site files and 
stage then in git, ready for committing.

Once prepared, you should check the git status to ensure no unexpected files are going to be published. If all is ready, 
simply got commit the files to the `master` branch, and push to the GitHub repo, whereupon the live site will be 
updated.
